I am thinking as an ML project, I can try and predict which travel destinations are most eco-friendly to travel to.
Say a customer starting point is x, my ml model can tell them to go to destinations [y1,y2...yn] in order of :

Core Dimensions

🌱 Environmental Impact

😊 Comfort

🌤 Weather Suitability

🔒 Safety & Security

Supporting Dimensions

✈️ Accessibility / Friction

💰 Affordability (proxy)

🌍 Destination Appeal
